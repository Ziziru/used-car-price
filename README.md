	Sourced from kaggle via the link above, Price will serve as the dependent variable, with mileage, year, status, model, and MSRP all acting as independent variables. 
  What’s worth noting is that cars with the status of new have ‘Not available’ for their mileage as their mileage is zero, as well as that for all three categories there are many observations with their MSRP as ‘not specified’.
